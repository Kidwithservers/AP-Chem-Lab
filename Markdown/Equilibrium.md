# Equilibrium Lab
## Experiment One: Equilibrium of solution

### Materials
- Graduated Cylander
- 100mL Beaker
- 40mL of H2O
- Holow Tube (2)

### Procedure
20 mL of water was measured into a graduated cylander, and into a 100mL beaker. Two drops of different colored food coloring were added to each contianer. Using the tubes, fluid was moved between the two vessles, until the amount of fluid had equalised.

### Data and observations
*(1)* I observed that the rate of transfer from the taller column of water in the graduated cylander initialy had a much faster transfer rate, but the rate decreased over time as the height of the fluid decreased. At the same time, the rate of transfer from the wider beaker increased. *(2)* If this transfer process continued indefinatly, change would only have occured until both sides had the same amount of fluid. At this point, each tube would transfer the same amount of fluid, and no change would be observed in the contianers. *(3)* If the size of the tube had been increased, this would be roughly analagous to the introduction of a catalyst, or an increase in temperature. This would lead to in increse in the rate that the reaction occured, but would not change the point of equilibrium. It would have been reached faster, but in the end, the amount of fluid that both continers desire is the same.

## Post Lab
### Analysis
*(1)* The rate of the water transfer decreased over time. As the amount of fluid in the graduated cylander, decreased, the amount avalible to be sucked into the tube decreased. This meant that the rate of change in the reaction went down, as there was less fluid able to be transmitted each time a transfer cycle occurred. *(2)* Once the reaction completed, the amount of fluid in both vesseles equilised. This was because both transfer devices were transfering at the same rate, so neither one could accumulate any more liquid.*(3)* In this case, the reactants had the same concentrations at the end of the reaction, but this is not always the case. For equilibrium to be acheived, both sides must have the same rate of transfer, not the same end ammount. This is because if the rate of transfer is the same, the concentration will never proceed further. *(4)* To conclude, the thing that is equal about equilibrium is the rate of the reaction. When equilibrium has been achevied, both sides will react at an equal rate, leaving no observiable chagne in reaction rate.
