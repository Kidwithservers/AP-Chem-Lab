# Equilibrium Lab
## Pre-lab
### Introduction
The concept of equilibrium is quite confusing, as there are many different meanings of the word. This lab will use a simple analogy to show how equilibrium in chemical reactions work. This lab will also show how reaction rates and concentrations are connected into the concept of equilibrium in chemical reactions, and how this concept relates to the behavior that we observe in real reactions. This information will help us better understand and interpret the results of other experiments.

## Experiment One: Equilibrium of solution
### Materials
- Graduated Cylinder
- 100mL Beaker
- 40mL of H2O
- Hollow Tube (2)
- Green and red dye

### Procedure
20mL of water was measured into a graduated cylinder, and into a 100mL beaker. Two drops of different colored food coloring were added to each container. Using the tubes, fluid was moved between the two vessels, until the amount of fluid had equalized.

### Data and observations
*(1)* I observed that the rate of transfer from the taller column of water in the graduated cylinder initially had a much faster transfer rate, but the rate decreased over time as the height of the fluid decreased. At the same time, the rate of transfer from the wider beaker increased. *(2)* If this transfer process continued indefinitely, change would only have occurred until both sides had the same amount of fluid. At this point, each tube would transfer the same amount of fluid, and no change would be observed in the containers. *(3)* If the size of the tube had been increased, this would be roughly analogous to the introduction of a catalyst, or an increase in temperature. This would lead to an increase in the rate that the reaction occurred, but would not change the point of equilibrium. It would have been reached faster, but in the end, the amount of fluid that both containers desire is the same.

## Post Lab
### Analysis
*(1)* The rate of the water transfer decreased over time. As the amount of fluid in the graduated cylinder, decreased, the amount available to be sucked into the tube decreased. This meant that the rate of change in the reaction went down, as there was less fluid able to be transmitted each time a transfer cycle occurred. *(2)* Once the reaction completed, the amount of fluid in both vessels equalized. This was because both transfer devices were transferring at the same rate, so neither one could accumulate any more liquid.*(3)* In this case, the reactants had the same concentrations at the end of the reaction, but this is not always the case. For equilibrium to be achieved, both sides must have the same rate of transfer, not the same end amount. This is because if the rate of transfer is the same, the concentration will never proceed further. *(4)* To conclude, the thing that is equal about equilibrium is the rate of the reaction. When equilibrium has been achieved, both sides will react at an equal rate, leaving no observable change in reaction rate.
