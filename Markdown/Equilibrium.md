# Equilibrium Lab
## Experiment One: Equilibrium of solution

### Materials
- Graduated Cylander
- 100mL Beaker
- 40mL of H2O
- Holow Tube (2)

### Procedure
20 mL of water was measured into a graduated cylander, and into a 100mL beaker. Two drops of different colored food coloring were added to each contianer. Using the tubes, fluid was moved between the two vessles, until the ammount of fluid had equalised.

### Data and observations
*(1)* I observed that the rate of transfer from the taller column of water in the graduated cylander initialy had a much faster transfer rate, but the rate decreased over time as the height of the fluid decreased. At the same time, the rate of transfer from the wider beaker increased. *(2)* If this transfer process continued indefinatly, change would only have occured until both sides had the same ammount of fluid. At this point, each tube would transfer the same ammount of fluid, and no change would be observed in the contianers. *(3)* If the size of the tube had been increased, this would be roughly analagous to the introduction of a catalyst, or an increase in temperature. This would lead to in increse in the rate that the reaction occured, but would not change the point of equilibrium. It would have been reached faster, but in the end, the ammount of fluid that both continers desire is the same.
