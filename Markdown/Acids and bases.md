### Introduction

## Experiment One: pH measurement of Ammonium Hydroxide and Formic Acid
### Materials
- pH meter
- Ammonium Hydroxide (10mL)
- Formic Acid (10mL)
- Beaker (2)
- Graduated cylinder (2)

### Procedure
10mL of each substance was measured with a graduated cylinder. It was then added to a beaker, and the pH of the fluid was measured with the meter.

### Data and observations
*(2)* When measured, the Ammonium Hydroxide had a pH of 10.93. *(1)* The ammonium hydroxide was initially formed by the reaction of ammonia gas (the conjugate base) and water (the conjugate acid). The reaction produced ammonium (the conjugate acid) and OH (the conjugate base) NH3 + H2O = NH4 + OH. *(3)* The calculated Kb of the ammonia 0.000017857. *(5b)* The actual Kb of this reaction is 1.710X10^-5, which means that the experiment had a percent error of 4.42%. *(4)* This shows that the Ammonium hydroxide is going to be on the loosing side of an equilibrium reaction. *(5)* The acid will not fully dissociate, or be favorable in equilibrium, therefore it will be a weak acid.

*(6)* When formic acid reacts with water it produces H3O+ (the conjugate acid) and HCOO- (the conjugate acid). *(7)* The formic acid had a measured pH of 1.43. The calculated Ka of this reaction is 0.00006011. *(10b)* The actual Ka of formic acid is 1.77 x 10-4, giving this experiment a percent error of -66%. *(9)* This Ka value means that this acid will not be favorable in a reaction. *(10)* This acid is weak, and will not fully disassociate. We can tell because it has a dis favorable equilibrium constant, in addition, all seven known strong acids have already been cataloged, and this was not found to be one of them.

## Experiment Two: Neutralization of substances
## Materials
- Formic Acid (10ml)
- Ammonium Hydroxide (10mL)
- Graduated Cylinder (2)
- Beaker
- pH meter

### Procedure
Both substances were mixed. The formic acid was slowly added to to ammonium hydroxide until the reaction completed.

### Data and observations
*(11)* The reaction of the substance was as follows: NH4OH + HCO2H = NH4HCO2 + H2O. *(12)* This reaction will produce the salt ammonium formate (NH4HCO2). This is a acidic salt, because formic acid has a higher Ka than ammonium hydroxide's Kb, an acidic salt will be produced. *(15)* Ammonium hydroxide has a density of 880 kg/m3, and a molar mass of 35.04 g/mol, resulting in 0.25 moles. Formic acid has a density of 1.22 g/cm3, and a molar mass of 46 g/mol, resulting in .265 mol of formic acid. Since this equation has a mol ratio of 1:1, ammonium hydroxide limits, .265 mol of ammonium formate will be produced. Since ammonium formate has a molar mass of 63 g/mol, this reaction will produce 15.76g will be produced. This reaction will also produce 4.5g of water.

## Post Lab
### Analysis
*(16)* The reaction between formic acid and ammonium hydroxide will likely have a Kc well under one. This is because it is between a weak acid and a weak base. Due to this, both reactants are unfavorable in the equilibrium reaction. *(19)* In order to calculate the Kc of both reactions, one would need to first know the molarities of ammonium formate and formic acid. One would then setup a rice equation using these values and substitute X in for the unknown quantities of product. Finally, one would insert these calculated values into the reaction's equilibrium equation, and solve. *(20)* Experimental and actually pH do not always match. This can be due to multiple factors. The most likely cause of poor pH readings is the presence of contaminants. Things like imperfections in the source chemicals, leftover reactants, and other similar things can pollute pH readings. These readings can also be damaged by poor meter positioning. If the probe is not calibrated or positioned correctly, this can throw off readings. The measured chemicals may also decay from when they were rated, throwing off ratings.
