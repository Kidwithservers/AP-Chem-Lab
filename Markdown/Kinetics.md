## Experiment One: Sodium Bicarbonate and Citric Acid
---
### Materials
- Alka-seltzer tablet (4)
- Beaker
- Water
- PH indicator

### Procedure
An Alka-seltzer tablet and 100ml of water was prepared for each reaction. The water had 6 drops of PH indicator added. Then the tablet was divided into the number of segments called for by each experiment, and was dropped into the prepared water, and a timer was started. The reaction was timed until completion.

### Data

| Variance | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Control (Whole Tablet) | 2:12 |
| Quarter Tablet | 2:12 |
| Powdered Tablet | 0:53 |
| Whole tablet (heated water) | 0:47 |

## Experiment Two: Decomposition of Hydrogen Peroxide
---
### Materials
- Hydrogen Peroxide (30%, 15%, 6%)
- Potassium Iodide
- Beaker
- Water
- PH indicator

### Procedure
Catalyst solution was diluted into various concentrations, with 5ml of .3M and .6M and 15ml of 1.2M KI solution being prepared. Hydrogen Peroxide was pre-diluted to the correct concentrations. Six drops of PH indicator was added to 50ml of water for the base solution. KI catalyst of required concentration was added to the peroxide, and a timer was started. All reactions were timed until completion.

### Data
#### Catalyst Concentration
| Variance | Time |
| --- | --- |
| 1.2M KI (Control) | 1:15 |
| .6M KI | 2:29 |
| .3M KI | 5:15 |

#### Peroxide Concentration
| Variance | Time |
| --- | --- |
| 30% Peroxide (Control) | 1:20 |
| 15% Peroxide | 3:30 |
| 3% Peroxide | +10:00 (Timed Out) |
