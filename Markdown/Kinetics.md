# Kinetics Lab

## Prelab
### Introduction
This lab explores the relationship between heat, surface area, and concnetration in reactions. Using several controled reactions, we will measure the effects of these factors, and relate them to the reactoion's kinetics. We will then use this information to predict the effects of these factors on the reaction's rate.

## Experiment One: Sodium Bicarbonate and Citric Acid
---
### Materials
- Alka-seltzer tablet (4)
- Beaker
- Water
- PH indicator

### Procedure
An Alka-seltzer tablet and 100ml of water was prepared for each reaction. The water had 6 drops of PH indicator added. Then the tablet was divided into the number of segments called for by each experiment, and was dropped into the prepared water, and a timer was started. The reaction was timed until completion.

### Data

| Variance | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Control (Whole Tablet) | 2:12 |
| Quarter Tablet | 2:12 |
| Powdered Tablet | 0:53 |
| Whole tablet (heated water) | 0:47 |

## Experiment Two: Decomposition of Hydrogen Peroxide
---
### Materials
- Hydrogen Peroxide (30%, 15%, 6%)
- Potassium Iodide
- Beaker
- Water
- PH indicator

### Procedure
Catalyst solution was diluted into various concentrations, with 5ml of .3M and .6M and 15ml of 1.2M KI solution being prepared. Hydrogen Peroxide was pre-diluted to the correct concentrations. Six drops of PH indicator was added to 50ml of water for the base solution. KI catalyst of required concentration was added to the peroxide, and a timer was started. All reactions were timed until completion.

### Data

## Analysis
*1* The reaction between the sodium bicarbonate and the citric acid had a formula of ```8 C6H8O7 + 9 NaHCO3 ==> 3 CO2 + 14 H2O + 9 NaC6H5O7```. This reaction was endothermic. *2* This reaction only started once the tablet was dissolved. This was because there was no surface area for the two reactants to react. Once they were dissolved, they could come into contact and react. In solid form, the citric acid did not have any water. This also made it difficult for it to react with the sodium bicarbonate. *4* In total, 43.7L of gas was produced. (Note that this is at STP)

*6* The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide has a formula of ``2 H2O2 ==> 2 H2O + O2``. *7* Both the concentration of the hydrogen peroxide and the reaction's catalyst had an impact on the rate of decomposition. This means that both the concentration of the hydrogen peroxide and the catalyst would have at least a rate coefficient of 1. *8* When calculated, the rate law of this reaction is ```r=k[H2O2][KI]```. *9* Since the concentration of both of these reactants doubles the speed of the reaction, both are first order, with the reaction overall being second order. Using this formula, it should be quite easy to solve for the rate constant. By substituting the rate that was experimentally found, and the supplied concentrations, this equation can be solved linearly. *10* The mechanism ``` H2O2 + I- ==> H2O + IO-; H2O2 + IO- ==> H2O + O2 + I- ``` is compatible with the observed rate law because the first, rate limiting reaction has two reactants with no coefficients, meaning that it is a second order overall reaction. *13* The rate of the decomposition of peroxide could have also been influenced by the room temperature. Increasing the ambient temperature will exponentially increase the rate of the reaction. This also works internally the peroxides that decomposed more vigorously produced a more exothermic reaction, which lead to the reaction progressing even further. Another potential factor was the presence of any additional kinetic energy. If any energy had been added to the reaction, the reaction may have proceeded faster. *14* To reduce the effects of these factors, The beakers could have been fixed in place on a ring stand. A larger beaker should have also been used, so that they did not need to be moved during the course of the experiment. The experiment could have also conducted in a climate-controlled environment, away from direct sunlight. A thermo-couple could have been inserted into the reaction while it was progressing, so that increases in temperature could be detected and accounted for.

*3* Surface area can increase rates of reaction significantly. Additional surface area exposes more molecules to collisions. Since collisions control the rate of the reaction, increasing the number of collisions will result in a speedup of the reaction rate. *5* Temperature is the biggest factor that influences reaction speed. This is because temperature exponentially increases reaction speed. When the temperature of a reaction increases, the speed of the molecules within rises. Increased speeds results in more collisions within the reaction, and therefore a faster rate. *12* We can use the laws regarding the rates of reactions to help improve medications, and other forms of drug distribution. This may help get pharmaceuticals into the correct parts of patient's bodies. Data about catalysts and concentrations may also help with the formation of fertilizers and other agents to help speed internal bodily reactions.
